# Project 6

Firestore

In this project, you will enhounce the online store Vue.js app by using Firestore.

## Objectives

- Acquire a profound understanding of executing **Create** and **Read** operations within **Firebase Firestore**.
- Gain a deep understanding of performing **Update** and **Delete** operations using Firebase Firestore.

## Preparation

1. Accept your instructor's [GitHub classroom invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/UXqHShgh) to set up your project repository.

   1. **Select Your Name:** ![select-name](../assets/img/project1-selectname.jpg)
   2. **Team Setup:**
      1. If your team does not exist yet, create a new team.
      2. If it already exists, join your existing team. !
   3. **Initialize Your Project Repository:**
   4. **Clone the Repository:** You're now ready to clone the repository. In your `terminal`, use the following command with your SSH repository link to download the repository to your local machine:

      ```bash
      git clone [YOUR_SSH_REPO_LINK]
      ```

   5. **Install Required Packages:** Execute the following command to install the necessary packages for your project:

      ```bash
      cd [YOUR_REPO]
      npm install
      ```

2. Run a local development server (default port 5173):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Then you can access your project at `localhost:5173` in browser.

## Instructions

1. **Initialization**:

   - Begin setting up your project by copying the necessary code from the src folder of Assignment 5 into the src folder of this repository. Make sure to include all files that are required for the basic functionality of your online store website.

2. Database Initialization Script
   - Objective: Develop a TypeScript script to initialize the store items within your Firebase Cloud Firestore.
   - Instructions:
     - Consult the class slides for guidance on setting up a new WebApp and initializing Firestore.
     - Implement a init() function in pinia that leverages Firestore's creation functions to establish collections and documents.
     - Incorporate a logical check for initialization: if the Firestore is empty, invoke data_init to populate data; otherwise, abstain from making the call.
3. Create
   - Implement a create button allowing users to add an item to Firestore.
4. **Delete Feature**:

   - Implement a delete button in `StoreItem.vue` allowing users to remove an item from Firestore.
   - Confirm deletion with a prompt to the user for confirmation before removing the item.

5. **Update Feature**:
   - Add a Modify button in `StoreItem.vue` enabling users to update the item's details (name, description, price, rating, stock, image, category). (5 points)
   - Display editable fields when the `Modify` button is clicked.
   - Include an `Update` button to save changes to Firestore.
   - Add a `Cancel` button to exit edit mode without saving changes.
   - Use a confirmation prompt to verify with the user before applying the updates.

## Expected Display

Your app should function similarly to the demo app available at [Demo App](https://gvsu-cis371.github.io/w24-project5). This is not the required final design; you are encouraged to develop your own style for the online store, while using Vue.js, Pinia, Vue Router, and Vuetify.

## Grading Rubrics

| Grading Item                            | Points |
| --------------------------------------- | -----: |
| Database Initialization                 |     20 |
| Create item                             |     20 |
| Modify item                             |     30 |
| Delete item                             |     20 |
| **Commit all changes & push to GitHub** |      5 |
| **GitHub Page Deployment**              |      5 |

## Deliverables

- Deploy your web application using the following commands in your `terminal`:

  ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
  ```
