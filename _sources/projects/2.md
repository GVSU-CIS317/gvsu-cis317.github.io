## Best Solutions from Project 1

- Section 1: [Electric Eels](https://gvsu-cis371.github.io/project1-electric-eels/)
- Section 2: [Deadline Racer](https://gvsu-cis371.github.io/project1-deadline-racers)

## Objectives

- Utilize TypeScript modules.
- Apply high-order functions.
- Implement event handling.

## Preparation

1. Accept your instructor's [GitHub classroom invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/sy1nLHaf) to set up your project repository.

   1. **Select Your Name:** ![select-name](../assets/img/project1-selectname.jpg)
   2. **Team Setup:**
      1. If your team does not exist yet, create a new team.
      2. If it already exists, join your existing team. !
   3. **Initialize Your Project Repository:**
   4. **Clone the Repository:** You're now ready to clone the repository. In your `terminal`, use the following command with your SSH repository link to download the repository to your local machine:

      ```bash
      git clone [YOUR_SSH_REPO_LINK]
      ```

   5. **Install Required Packages:** Execute the following command to install the necessary packages for your project:

      ```bash
      cd [YOUR_REPO]
      npm install
      ```

2. Run a local development server (default port 5173):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Then you can access your project at `localhost:5173` in browser.

## Instructions

In this project, you will work within `index.html` and `data-controller.ts`. Your task is to implement TypeScript code to achieve the following:

- Complete the `renderProducts` function in `data-controller.ts`: Ensure all products are rendered in `<main id="main-container">` within `index.html`.
- Complete the `getByCategory` function in `data-controller.ts`: Fetch all products of a given category and render the selected products into HTML.
- Complete the `getByRating` function in `data-controller.ts` : Fetch all products with a rating greater than the specified minRating and render the selected products into HTML.
- Bind Click Events: Use `.addEventListener` to handle click events for the navigation links in index.html. Upon clicking:

  - "Electronics" should display all products categorized as "Electronics."
  - "Clothing" should display all products categorized as "Clothing."
  - "Groceries" should display all products categorized as "Groceries."
  - "Best Seller" should display all products with a rating greater than 4.5.

## Grading Rubrics

| Grading Item                            | Points |
| --------------------------------------- | -----: |
| **renderProducts**                      |     20 |
| **getByCategory:**                      |     20 |
| **getByRating:**                        |     20 |
| **click events handling:**              |     30 |
| **Commit all changes & push to GitHub** |      5 |
| **GitHub Page Deployment**              |      5 |

## Deliverables

- Deploy your web application using the following commands in your `terminal`:

  ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
  ```

- Github Page Setup

  - Set up your GitHub repository for GitHub Pages deployment. Follow the steps shown in the image below: ![Layout](../assets/img/project1-githubpage.jpg).
  - Your web application will be accessible at the URL: gvsu-cis371.github.io/YOUR-REPO

- Submit the URL of your GitHub Page in Blackboard.
