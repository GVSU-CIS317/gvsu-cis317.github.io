# Project 5

Vue.js Online Store App

In this project, you will rebuild an online store app using Vue.js, leveraging various tools and libraries such as Pinia, Vuetify, and Vue Router.

## Objectives

- Utilize Vue.js to build components to create a dynamic and responsive user interface for the online store.
- Manage application state using Pinia, handling actions and state.
- Implement Vuetify to design and structure the UI without custom CSS.
- Navigate between different parts of the application using Vue Router.

## Preparation

1. Accept your instructor's [GitHub classroom invitation](https://classroom.github.com/a/SGiPqt5R) to set up your project repository.

   1. **Select Your Name:** ![select-name](../assets/img/project1-selectname.jpg)
   2. **Team Setup:**
      1. If your team does not exist yet, create a new team.
      2. If it already exists, join your existing team. !
   3. **Initialize Your Project Repository:**
   4. **Clone the Repository:** You're now ready to clone the repository. In your `terminal`, use the following command with your SSH repository link to download the repository to your local machine:

      ```bash
      git clone [YOUR_SSH_REPO_LINK]
      ```

   5. **Install Required Packages:** Execute the following command to install the necessary packages for your project:

      ```bash
      cd [YOUR_REPO]
      npm install
      ```

2. Run a local development server (default port 5173):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Then you can access your project at `localhost:5173` in browser.

## Instructions

Build an online store using Vue.js, Pinia, Vuetify, and Vue Router by completing the following tasks:

- **ProductStore:**

  - Implement `ProductStore.ts` with a **products** state, initially an empty array of ProductDoc (defined in types/product.ts).
  - Define actions in `ProductStore.ts`:
    - init(): Initializes the **products** with initProducts from `data-init.ts`.
    - filterByCategory(category: string): Filters products by category.
    - filterByRating(minRating: number): Filters products with ratings above minRating.

- **Vue Components:** Create the following components with **Vuetify**, <b style="color:red;">avoiding any custom CSS code.</b>

  - Create `StoreItem.vue` to present detailed information of a product.
  - Create `Home.vue` to display all products in a grid layout.
  - Create category-specific components (`Clothing.vue`, `Electronics.vue`, `Groceries.vue`) and `BestSeller.vue` to display products in those categories and best-sellers (rating above 4.5) respectively.

- **Vue Router:** Set up routes for Clothing, Electronics, Groceries, and Best Sellers in `router.ts` using paths `/clothing`, `/electronics`, `/groceries`, and `/bestseller`.

## Expected Display

Your app should function similarly to the demo app available at [Demo App](https://gvsu-cis371.github.io/w24-project5). This is not the required final design; you are encouraged to develop your own style for the online store, while using Vue.js, Pinia, Vue Router, and Vuetify.

## Grading Rubrics
