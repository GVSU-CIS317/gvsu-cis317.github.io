Provide the Emmet abbreviation for generating the following HTML DOM structures.

**Example Question**

    ```bash
    body
    |-- header
    |-- main
    |-- footer
    ```

    Answer: header+main+footer

1. Build a basic layout of a web page with a header, main content area, and a footer. The header should contain a heading and a navigation section.

   ```bash
   body
   |-- header
   |   |-- h1
   |   |   |-- "My Store"
   |   |-- nav
   |-- main
   |-- footer
   ```

   Answer: `body>(header>h1{My Store}+nav)+main+footer`

2. Construct a navigation menu consisting of several hyperlinks.

   ```bash
   nav
   |-- ul
       |-- li
       |   |-- `a` with href = #.
       |       |-- "Link 1"
       |-- li
       |   |-- `a` with href = #.
       |       |-- "Link 2"
       |-- li
       |   |-- `a` with href = #.
       |       |-- "Link 3"
       |-- li
           |-- `a` with href = #.
               |-- "Link 4"
   ```

   Answer: `nav>ul>li*4>a[href=#]{Link $}`

3. Enhanced Footer Section: Create a more complex footer section with copyright information, social media links, and a back-to-top button.

   ```bash
   footer
   |-- p
   |   |-- "© 2024 My Online Store. All rights reserved."
   |-- nav
   |   |-- ul
   |       |-- li
   |       |   |-- `a` with href = #.
   |       |       |-- "Social Link 1"
   |       |-- li
   |       |   |-- `a` with href = #.
   |       |       |-- "Social Link 2"
   |       |-- li
   |           |-- `a` with href = #.
   |               |-- "Social Link 3"
   |-- `a` with href = top.
       |-- "Top"
   ```

   Answer: `foot>p{© 2024 My Online Store. All rights reserved.}+(nav>ul>li*3>a[href=#]{Social Link $})+a[href=top]{Top}`

4. Construct a main section containing a grid layout for a store, with several rows and columns representing different store items.

   ```bash
   main
   |-- div with class = "container"
       |-- div with class = "row"
       |   |-- div with class = "col"
       |   |   |-- div with class = "store-item"
       |   |-- div with class = "col"
       |   |   |-- div with class = "store-item"
       |   |-- div with class = "col"
       |   |   |-- div with class = "store-item"
       |   |-- div with class = "col"
       |   |   |-- div with class = "store-item"
       |   |-- div with class = "col"
       |       |-- div with class = "store-item"
       |-- div with class = "row"
       |   |-- div with class = "col"
       |   |   |-- div with class = "store-item"
       |   |-- div with class = "col"
       |   |   |-- div with class = "store-item"
       |   |-- div with class = "col"
       |   |   |-- div with class = "store-item"
       |   |-- div with class = "col"
       |   |   |-- div with class = "store-item"
       |   |-- div with class = "col"
       |       |-- div with class = "store-item"
       |-- div with class = "row"
           |-- div with class = "col"
           |   |-- div with class = "store-item"
           |-- div with class = "col"
           |   |-- div with class = "store-item"
           |-- div with class = "col"
           |   |-- div with class = "store-item"
           |-- div with class = "col"
           |   |-- div with class = "store-item"
           |-- div with class = "col"
               |-- div with class = "store-item"
   ```

   Answer: `main>div.container>div.row*3>div.col*5>div.store-item`

5. Think about a possible DOM tree for a store item container (such as a div with class = "store-item"), which includes elements like an image, name, product description, rating, price, and stock availability. Write the Emmet abbreviation to generate this HTML structure.

![storeItem](../assets/img/store_item.jpg)

For Further Thought: Can you use a single-line Emmet abbreviation to generate all the elements in the HTML document as depicted in the following image? ![storeItem](../assets/img/quiz1-page-layout.jpg)

Answer: `div.store-item>img[src=img-url]+p{name}+p{product desctiption}+span{4.5/5}+span{\$1200}+span{stock:5}`
